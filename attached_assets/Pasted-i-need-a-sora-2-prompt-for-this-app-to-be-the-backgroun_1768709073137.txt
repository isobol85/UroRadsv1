i need a sora 2 prompt for this app to be the background video that loops. currenlty i have the background is a robot looking at a CT scan while pearls are cycled every so often do you see that video?

Let me explore the codebase to understand the app and find the current background video implementation.

I can see the app and the LoadingPearls component. This is a medical education app for urology radiology, and the current background video shows a robot/hologram figure analyzing CT scans while the 207 radiology pearls cycle every 9 seconds with a progress bar.

The video file is at /attached_assets/download_1768275325435.mp4. I can't directly view video files, but based on your description and the code comments ("Version 1: Robot/Hologram cinematic video"), I understand the aesthetic.

Here's a Sora 2 prompt tailored for your UroRads app background:

Sora 2 Prompt for UroRads Background Video
Prompt:

A cinematic seamless loop of a humanoid robot with a sleek, dark metallic body and subtle teal-glowing accents standing in a dimly lit futuristic medical imaging room. The robot is studying floating holographic CT scan slices of a human abdomen and urinary tract that rotate slowly in front of it. The holograms emit a soft teal and white glow, casting ambient light across the robot's reflective surface. The robot occasionally tilts its head or gestures subtly toward the scans with precision. The background is dark with minimal detail—deep black and slate gray tones—with faint holographic data streams or medical waveforms drifting in the distant background. The mood is calm, clinical, and contemplative. Shallow depth of field keeps focus on the robot and holograms. The lighting is low-key and dramatic. Film grain. 4K. Perfect loop.

Alternative prompt (more abstract/ambient):

An endless cinematic loop of floating holographic CT scan cross-sections of human kidneys and ureters slowly rotating in a dark void. The scans glow with soft teal and cyan light, creating gentle reflections on an unseen surface below. Subtle digital particles and data fragments drift through the scene like dust motes. A shadowy silhouette of an AI medical assistant observes from the edge of frame. The atmosphere is serene, clinical, and futuristic. Dramatic low-key lighting. Seamless loop. 4K resolution. Cinematic depth of field with soft bokeh.

Key elements I included to match your app:
Teal accent color (matches your text-teal-400, bg-teal-500 theme)
Dark/black background (matches bg-black, bg-slate-900/60 glass cards)
CT scans / urinary tract imagery (matches urology radiology content)
Robot/AI figure (matches current "robot looking at CT scan" concept)
Calm/clinical mood (won't distract from the cycling pearl text)
Seamless loop (critical for background video that loops)
Low-key lighting (ensures text overlay remains readable)
Would you like me to adjust the prompt—perhaps more action, different color palette, or a different style (more abstract vs. figurative)?

whats an abstract version of the current robot looking at cat scans. metal and electricity looking at metal and electrolicity

Love that concept—stripping away the figurative robot and CT scan into pure essence: metal and electricity observing metal and electricity. Here's an abstract Sora 2 prompt:

Abstract Sora 2 Prompt
Prompt:

A seamless cinematic loop of abstract metallic forms suspended in darkness. A large, liquid-metal sphere hovers on the left, its chrome surface rippling with slow, organic distortions. Tendrils of teal and white electricity arc gracefully from the sphere toward floating rectangular metallic plates on the right—the plates rotate slowly, revealing circuit-like etchings that pulse with faint light as the electricity touches them. The electrical currents move with intention, scanning and probing the plates methodically. The atmosphere is dark, clinical, infinite black void. Reflections dance across the metal surfaces. The energy feels intelligent, contemplative. Slow motion. Shallow depth of field. Dramatic low-key lighting with teal and cool white accents. Film grain. 4K. Perfect seamless loop.

Even more minimal/meditative version:

An endless loop of pure abstraction in darkness. A hovering mass of brushed steel and liquid chrome pulses with internal teal light, emitting slow arcs of electricity that reach toward distant floating metal fragments. The fragments are thin, clinical, like suspended surgical steel catching light. The electricity wraps around them gently, examining, learning. Everything moves slowly, deliberately. Deep black void. Reflections. The only colors are teal, white, and the cool gray of metal. Silent. Hypnotic. Seamless loop. Cinematic. 4K.

Ultra-abstract version:

Darkness. A sphere of rippling liquid metal breathes with teal bioluminescence. Electric filaments extend outward like synapses, connecting to floating shards of polished steel that rotate in slow orbit. The electricity pulses in rhythms—scanning, thinking. Metal observing metal. Energy studying energy. No ground, no horizon, only infinite black. Reflections multiply in the chrome surfaces. Slow, meditative, endless. Perfect loop. 4K cinematic.

The core visual language:
Element	Represents
Liquid metal sphere	The AI "observer"
Electrical arcs	The act of analysis/thinking
Floating metal plates/shards	The medical data being studied
Teal glow	Your app's accent color
Infinite black void	Clinical, focused, no distractions
Slow deliberate motion	Contemplation, intelligence
Want me to push it even more abstract, or blend in subtle medical imagery (like faint cross-section shapes in the metal plates)?

it came out too "ominous"

i need it to follow principles that are known for best practices for to get people to want to look at their screen

Great feedback. "Ominous" happens when you go too dark, too dramatic, too cyberpunk-dystopian. Let me reframe with engagement psychology principles:

What makes people WANT to look at screens:
Principle	Application
Warmth + cool balance	Add warm accents (soft gold, amber) alongside teal—not just cold blue/black
Light, not darkness	Soft gradients, luminosity, "morning" not "midnight"
Organic flow	Smooth, breathing motion—like water, clouds, aurora
Biophilic elements	Humans are drawn to nature-like patterns (flowing, growing)
Optimism	Rising, expanding, opening—not closing, probing, encroaching
Gentle complexity	Interesting but not overwhelming; calm curiosity
Revised Sora 2 Prompt (Inviting + Abstract)
Prompt:

A seamless cinematic loop of abstract luminous forms floating in a soft gradient space—deep teal fading to warm charcoal. A glowing orb of liquid chrome hovers gently, its surface catching light like morning sun on water. Soft ribbons of golden-white electricity flow outward in graceful arcs, connecting to floating translucent panels that shimmer with faint geometric patterns. The motion is slow, breathing, meditative—like watching clouds or gentle waves. The electricity feels curious, not aggressive. Warm highlights mix with cool teal tones. The mood is calm, hopeful, intelligent. Soft ambient glow. Shallow depth of field with gentle bokeh. Smooth and inviting. 4K. Perfect seamless loop.

Alternative (more ethereal/nature-inspired):

An endless loop of soft abstraction. A polished silver form floats in a space of deep teal and soft warm gray gradients. Gentle streams of light—white and pale gold—flow from it like slow-motion aurora, reaching toward floating crystalline shapes that rotate peacefully. Everything breathes slowly, rises gently, glows softly. The feeling is wonder, not fear. Curiosity, not surveillance. Like bioluminescence in calm water. Warm and cool light in harmony. Soft focus. Cinematic. Seamless loop. 4K.

Key shifts from the ominous version:

Before (Ominous)	After (Inviting)
"Darkness," "void," "infinite black"	"Soft gradient," "warm charcoal," "deep teal fading to warm"
"Tendrils," "probing," "scanning"	"Ribbons," "flowing," "reaching gently"
"Dramatic low-key lighting"	"Soft ambient glow," "morning sun on water"
Cold teal only	Teal + warm gold/amber accents
"Methodical," "precision"	"Breathing," "curious," "wonder"
Static/heavy	Rising, floating, gentle motion
Want me to push even lighter/warmer, or does this feel closer to the right vibe?

give me a third one to launch. i have it loading now in sora

Here's a third option—different angle, same inviting principles:

Option 3: Flowing Intelligence
Prompt:

A seamless cinematic loop of soft liquid metal pooling and flowing in gentle waves across an unseen surface. The metal is warm silver with subtle rose-gold and teal reflections. Above it, delicate arcs of light rise and fall like slow breathing—soft white and pale amber electricity that never strikes, only floats and connects. Small luminous particles drift upward like embers from a calm fire. The background is a soft gradient of slate blue to warm gray, like pre-dawn sky. Everything moves with peaceful intention. The mood is quiet wonder, gentle intelligence, warmth. Soft focus, cinematic bokeh. Smooth, hypnotic, calming. 4K. Perfect seamless loop.

What makes this one different:

Horizontal flow (grounding) vs. floating in void
Rose-gold/amber warmth mixed in
Rising particles = optimism, growth, aspiration
"Pre-dawn sky" = hope, new beginnings
"Breathing" motion = alive but calm
Good luck with the renders! Let me know which direction hits closest and I can refine from there.

do another one. go to the "tails" of your training data outputs. of the curve of the data you base your answers on.

Going to the tails—unexpected, less obvious, weirder but still warm:

Option 4: Honey and Glass
Prompt:

A seamless cinematic loop of warm amber honey slowly dripping upward in reverse, defying gravity, pooling into floating glass orbs that glow from within. The honey catches light like liquid sunlight. The glass orbs rotate slowly, containing tiny galaxies of soft teal and gold sparks. Thin threads of luminous white connect the orbs like a constellation being born. The background is a soft peach-to-slate gradient, like the last moment before sunrise. The motion is impossibly slow, dreamlike, suspended. It feels like watching a thought form. Warm. Strange. Beautiful. Soft focus throughout. 4K. Perfect seamless loop.

Why this is "tail" territory:

Reverse gravity (unusual physics)
Honey as a metaphor for intelligence (organic, golden, slow)
Glass containing tiny galaxies (scale paradox)
"Watching a thought form" (synesthetic framing)
Peach-to-slate palette (unexpected warmth, not typical tech colors)
Want another tail pull, or does this spark something?

  "On CTU, a hyperdense focus in the renal pelvis on noncontrast that disappears on contrast images can be concentrated urine; confirm with delayed excretory phase before calling a stone.",
  "Physiologic hydronephrosis of pregnancy is typically right-sided and smooth; an abrupt ureteral cutoff or disproportionate pain should prompt a careful distal ureter search.",
  "On contrast CT, a 'persistent nephrogram' (kidney stays dense on delayed images) suggests severe obstruction, hypotension, or acute tubular injury—interpret with clinical context.",
  "An enhancing urothelial lesion is easiest to see against opacified urine; add a late excretory delay if the collecting system isn’t well coated.",
  "Use window/level adjustments for stones: a wider window often reveals tiny calcifications that vanish on soft-tissue settings.",
  "When evaluating a suspected UPJ obstruction, look for a crossing lower pole artery/vein on arterial phase or CTA; it can change surgical planning.",
  "In a dilated collecting system, check for calyceal ballooning versus pelvic-only dilation; calyceal dilation supports true obstruction.",

  "Bladder diverticula: a mass within a diverticulum is easier to miss because the wall is thin—scrutinize for focal enhancing nodules.",
  "A urachal remnant appears as a midline tubular or cystic structure from the bladder dome to umbilicus; calcifications in a urachal mass raise concern for malignancy.",
  "Gas in the bladder lumen alone is often iatrogenic; gas in the bladder wall is emphysematous cystitis until proven otherwise.",
  "In suspected colovesical fistula, look for air in the bladder without instrumentation plus focal bladder wall thickening adjacent to inflamed sigmoid colon.",
  "An enterovesical fistula can be subtle—oral contrast in the bladder on delayed imaging is a strong confirmatory clue.",

  "In suspected renal dysplasia, look for echogenic small kidney with poor corticomedullary differentiation; correlate with function if needed.",
  "Hydronephrosis with a dilated proximal ureter but normal distal ureter suggests a mid-ureteral crossing vessel or stricture; identify the transition point.",
  "A retrocaval ureter (circumcaval) causes a 'fishhook' or S-shaped proximal ureter on imaging; it’s a right-sided classic.",
  "In renal failure, a noncontrast MRI (T2 + DWI) can still characterize many masses; don’t assume contrast is mandatory.",

  "Post-prostatectomy, a small enhancing nodule at the vesicourethral anastomosis is a common recurrence pattern; compare to PSA rise timing.",

  "In staging RCC, scrutinize the ipsilateral adrenal; direct invasion is uncommon but important when present.",
  "A small enhancing lesion in the contralateral kidney in RCC patient may be synchronous primary; describe separately from metastasis assumptions.",
  "Renal sinus invasion in RCC can be subtle; look for tumor extending into sinus fat and collecting system distortion.",
  "Perinephric fat stranding alone does not equal T3a in RCC; focal nodular fat invasion is more convincing than hazy stranding.",
  "Collecting system invasion can present as hematuria and filling defects; excretory phase can show tumor protruding into calyces.",
  "In AML, intratumoral aneurysms >5 mm raise hemorrhage risk; describe them if seen on contrast studies.",
  "Spontaneous perirenal hemorrhage (Wunderlich) should trigger a search for underlying tumor, especially AML or RCC.",
  "A renal pseudoaneurysm after biopsy/partial nephrectomy may only show on arterial phase; look for a round enhancing focus with a feeding artery.",

  "A markedly thickened bladder wall with small capacity suggests chronic outlet obstruction or neurogenic bladder; correlate with trabeculation.",
  "Bladder stones often sit dependently and may change position; prone imaging can separate stones from fixed mural lesions.",
  "Intravesical clot can mimic tumor; a nonenhancing, layered, or mobile filling defect supports clot.",

  "Don’t forget to evaluate the renal arteries when the kidney is infarcted; a dissection flap or embolic occlusion may be visible.",
  "Renal vein thrombosis can cause an enlarged kidney with decreased enhancement and perinephric edema; direct thrombus in the vein seals the diagnosis.",
  "Nutcracker phenomenon: dilated left renal vein with collateralization and hematuria; look for compression between SMA and aorta.",
  "In varicocele evaluation, measure vein caliber and use Valsalva; augmentation with Valsalva supports true varicocele.",
  "A left-sided varicocele with left renal mass raises concern for renal vein invasion or compression; check the left renal vein carefully.",
  "An epidermoid cyst shows an 'onion-skin' lamellated appearance and avascularity; recognizing it can prevent overtreatment.",

  "Hematoma is typically avascular on Doppler; any internal vascularity suggests viable tissue or a mass rather than pure blood.",
  "Segmental testicular torsion can occur; compare flow regionally, not just globally, especially if symptoms are focal.",
  "Scrotal wall edema with normal testis can still be cellulitis; look for subcutaneous gas if concern for necrotizing infection.",
  "In penile fracture, ultrasound can show tunica albuginea disruption and hematoma; MRI is excellent when US is equivocal.",
  "Mondor disease (superficial dorsal vein thrombosis) shows a noncompressible thrombosed vein on Doppler; it can mimic a palpable cord.",

  "Ejaculatory duct obstruction can present with dilated seminal vesicles and midline prostatic cyst; MRI can show the obstructing lesion.",
  "A midline prostatic utricle cyst is associated with hypospadias and intersex variants; a Mullerian duct cyst is usually larger and extends above the prostate.",
  "On CT, asymmetric enlargement and hyperenhancement of the seminal vesicle can indicate invasion from prostate cancer; compare sides.",
  "In bladder outlet obstruction, intravesical prostatic protrusion can look like a bladder mass; continuity with prostate on sagittal images clarifies it.",
  "A median lobe can create a 'ball-valve' effect at the bladder neck; describing protrusion helps urologic decision-making.",
  "After pelvic radiation, the bladder may show diffuse thickening and decreased capacity; focal enhancing masses still require tumor exclusion.",
  "Ureteral stents can cause apparent wall thickening and periureteral stranding; interpret suspected ureteritis/tumor with caution in stented ureters.",

  "Encrusted stents can show calcification along the stent course; look at both ends where encrustation is commonest.",
  "After ureteroscopy, small ureteral wall edema can narrow the lumen; short-term mild hydroureter is common—look for a clear obstructing lesion before calling stricture.",
